Pbitx is a replacement for the arduino in Ubitx v6, itÂ´s based on the Raspberry Pi Pico micro controller.

It contains software written in C, the code is a rework of the ubitxv6-master branch and some replaced/added files from myself.
The name is a combination of Pico and Ubitx resulting in Pbitx.  

Hardware design files can be found in the PCB folder and the subfolder AGC.
There are two Kicad designs the first on is the adapter that replace the Arduino with a RPI Pico controller. The second one is an
AGC detector it is used by some functions, S-Meter and a pan-scope, The detector is based on ND6T's design with some extra components added.
